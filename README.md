# Qawaid-Dataset

We presents a parallel dataset of Arabic text that contains around 59,647 ungrammatical sentences alongside their 59,647 grammatically error-free counterparts labeled by the type of error they contain. By utilizing sequence to sequence models, this corpus may be used for grammar error correction for the Arabic language or for other tasks. Sentences were acquired from Arabic Wikipedia dump 2021 and LABR Datasets and were manually annotated and revised by Arabic language experts. 

Based on the originality of errors, the dataset was divided into two CSV files with synthetic and natural errors. The 56,236 sentences that have synthetic errors can be found in the Synthetic.csv file, while the 3411 sentences which have natural errors can be found in Original.csv. We have also provided an Qawaid_Dataset.csv file which contains the full corpus of 59,647 pairs of sentences.
